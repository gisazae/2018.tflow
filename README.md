# 2018/1 Machine Learning for Image Processing with TensorFlow

We will be using a virtual machine with all required libraries. Contact me at [rramosp@unal.edu.co](mail.torramosp@unal.edu.co) to get it.

Make sure the virtual machine is set with **two virtual cores** and **2048 GB RAM** at least.

Start the VM and open your browser at http://localhost:8008

It is recommended to close all applications on your physical machine and use a lightweight browser (http://www.maxthon.com/, https://www.qupzilla.com/,  etc).
